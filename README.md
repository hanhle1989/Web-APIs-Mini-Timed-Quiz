# Web-APIs-Mini-Timed-Quiz
Week 4 Homework: develop a time quiz

## Develop a mini timed quiz that:
```
WHEN I click the start button
THEN a timer starts at 60 seconds and I am presented with a question
WHEN I answer a question
THEN I am presented with another question
WHEN I answer a question incorrectly
THEN 10 seconds are subtracted from the clock
OR WHEN I answer a question correctly
THEN 5 seconds are added to the clock
WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0
THEN the game is over
WHEN the game is over
THEN I can save my initials and my score

Note: The score is the same as the remained time
```
